# [Golang.hr] Slack Invite Installation Guide

**TBD**

### [Go] Required

You will need to have [Go] 1.4+ installed and ready for use.

If you're unsure how to do it or need any sort of help, please navigate yourself to
[Go Getting Started]. Go team explained very nicely what you need to do depending on your
environment.

### [Etcd] Required

Yes, yes! We're limiting stuff. I know, that's not good but as [Golang.hr] wants one day to
have it's own services, it's logical that we have configuration management on one place that's
resilient and just works. Due to that, you'll have to bring up [Etcd] instance in order to use this service.

In order to install [Etcd] please go to [Etcd Git] and read through their README
