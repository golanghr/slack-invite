# Contributing to [Golang.hr Slack Invite]

[Golang.hr Slack Invite] is an open source project based on [Golang.hr Platform].
Bellow you can find basic guidelines on how to file new issue or contribute with your own code.

## Filing issues

When [filing an issue], make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

General questions should go to the [Golang.hr Slack] or [Golang.hr Facebook] instead of the issue tracker.
The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

## Sign Your Work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch.
Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from developercertificate.org):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
```

In short, you need to add a line to every git commit message:

```Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>```

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
If you set your user.name and user.email git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with git commit -s.

## Contributing code

Interested in contributing code? Great :) These are short guides (for now) on how to
contribute.

1. Each and every single line of the code you wish to submit must come with
   valid and working **tests**
