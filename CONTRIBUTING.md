# Contributing to [Golang.hr Slack Invite]

[Golang.hr Slack Invite] is an open source project based on [Golang.hr Platform].
Bellow you can find basic guidelines on how to file new issue or contribute with your own code.

## Filing issues

When [filing an issue], make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

General questions should go to the [Golang.hr Slack] or [Golang.hr Facebook] instead of the issue tracker.
The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

## Contributing code

Interested in contributing code? Great :) These are short guides (for now) on how to
contribute.

1. Each and every single line of the code you wish to submit must come with
   valid and working **tests**

**We do accept GitHub pull requests**
